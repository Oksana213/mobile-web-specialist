# 03.25: QUIZ: TRIGGERING AN UPDATE
First get the project into the sample state by using the following commands:

```shell
$ git reset --hard
$ git checkout task-update-reload

```

Once the task is complete, enter the Task ID: **update-reload**

## CODING TASK
First take a look in `public/js/main/IndexController.js`. The `_updateReady` method of the `IndexController` is being called whenever there is an update ready to show. We implemented that in the last task, but we're now passing the `Service Worker` into the method.

In `_updateReady`, the new version message is shown and then if the user clicks the 'refresh' button, you will need to tell the new `Service Worker` to tell it to take over control of pages immediately. You'll need to handle this message in the `Service Worker`.

Over in `public/js/sw/index.js`, at the bottom there is a TODO. Here is where you can listen for the message to take over page control.

Back in `public/js/main/IndexController.js`, there is a TODO in the `_registerServiceWorker` method of the `IndexController`. You need to listen for the pages controlling `Service Worker` to change and use that as a signal to reload the page.

Once you've finished, you need to get those changes picked up by the browser by deleting the existing `Service Worker` and refresh the page. Next, make a change to your `Service Worker` and then refresh the page.

Once you've got it working, head over to the settings page and put in the Task ID and press enter. You have 8-seconds to hit the refresh button in the notification. This will confirm it's all working.

  Inside the `public/js/main/IndexControler.js` file, the `_updateReady` method should look like this:
  
  ```js
  IndexController.prototype._updateReady = function(worker) {
    var toast = this._toastsView.show("New version available", {
      buttons: ['refresh', 'dismiss']
    });

    toast.answer.then(function(answer) {
      if (answer != 'refresh') return;
      // TODO: tell the service worker to skipWaiting
      worker.postMessage({
        action: 'skipWaiting'
      });
    });
  };
  ```
  
  Inside the `public/js/sw/index.js` file:
  
  ```js
  // TODO: listen for the "message" event, and call
  // skipWaiting if you get the appropriate message
  self.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.data.action === 'skipWaiting') {
      self.skipWaiting();
    }
  });
  ```
  
  Back inside the `IndexController.js` file, at the end of the `_registerServiceWorker` method:
  
  ```js
  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('controllerchange', function(){
    window.location.reload();
  });
  ```
